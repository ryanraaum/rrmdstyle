### Heading 3

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First let's generate some simulated data for 1000 statistical tests: we'll have 950 where the null is true and 50 where the null is false. 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

$$\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$$

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, 1:4]))
```


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r cars-head}
head(cars)
```

> This is a blockquote

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example: 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
mydata = data.frame(x=1:10, y=1:10)
ggplot(mydata, aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0,5)
```

```{r}
x = 
```

This is an unordered list:

- First item
- Second item
- Third

This is an ordered list:

1. Numero uno
2. Numero dos

# Addendum: Toolkit So Far

`str`

: Show the structure of an R object. Prints out the structure. Returns nothing.

```r
str(object)
```

`summary`

: Summarize the contents of an R object. Returns a summary object.

```r
summary(object)
```
